# VoltVisor: AI-Powered Energy Intelligence Platform

VoltVisor is a sophisticated web application built with React that provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring, forecasting, and analyzing energy consumption in manufacturing plants. It leverages an AI-powered backend to deliver predictive insights, helping businesses optimize energy usage, reduce costs, and minimize their carbon footprint.

## Key Features

VoltVisor is organized into three main tabs, each offering a suite of powerful features:

### 1\. Monitoring

This tab provides a real-time and historical overview of energy consumption.

  * **Live Dashboard**: View the current energy consumption for the entire plant and for individual processes like Painting, Welding, and HVAC.
  * **Energy Mix**: Instantly see the breakdown of energy from renewable vs. non-renewable sources.
  * **Historical Trends**: Analyze past energy usage with interactive line and bar charts. You can customize the date range and toggle the visibility of different process lines.
  * **Emissions Tracking**: Monitor CO₂ emissions with daily trend lines and process-wise stacked bar charts.
  * **Cost Analysis**: Get a detailed breakdown of energy costs by source (Grid, Wind, Solar, Hydro) based on location-specific rates.
  * **Plant Comparison**: Benchmark the performance of multiple plants against each other in terms of energy consumption and CO₂ emissions.

### 2\. Forecasting

This tab looks to the future, providing predictive analytics and planning tools.

  * **Energy & Cost Forecasts**: See predicted energy consumption and the associated costs for a selected future period.
  * **Alerts & Anomaly Detection**: Receive timely alerts for critical issues, warnings, and informational events, such as predicted energy spikes or equipment deviations.
  * **Scenario Planner**: A powerful simulation tool that allows you to see the impact of:
      * Increasing or decreasing production volume.
      * Adjusting the mix of renewable energy sources (Wind, Solar, Hydro).
      * This helps in making informed decisions to optimize for cost and sustainability.

### 3\. Insights

This tab leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide qualitative analysis and actionable recommendations.

  * **Forecast Rationale**: Get plain-English explanations of what's driving the energy forecast, such as weather conditions, production schedules, or historical load.
  * **Feature Importance**: Visualize which factors are most influential in the energy prediction models.
  * **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Receive concrete, actionable suggestions for optimizing energy consumption and reducing emissions, tailored to the specific patterns observed in your plant's data.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, robust tech stack:

  * **Frontend**: React
  * **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
  * **Data Visualization**: Recharts
  * **Icons**: Lucide React
  * **API Communication**: The application fetches data from a custom backend API. All API calls are neatly organized in the `src/apiService.js` file.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/rishit-jaiswal/my-voltvisor-app.git
    ```
2.  Install NPM packages:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the App

To run the app in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

## Backend API

This frontend application is designed to work with a backend service that provides all the necessary data. The base URL for the API is `https://energy-forecasting-production.up.railway.app/api`.

The API provides endpoints for:

  * Plant and process information
  * Historical and forecasted energy data
  * Equipment readings
  * Monthly summaries
  * Scenario planning simulations
  * Alerts and anomalies

You can find more details about the API endpoints in the `src/apiService.js` file and the included Postman collection, `MFG.postman_collection.json`.
